        <h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Sam Werlin and I live in New Haven, Connecticut. I am a ninth grader at Engineering and Science University Magnet School, or ESUMS for short. At school, I am interested the most in science and social studies class. Biology is very captivating, but I also love learning about past and current events. I find history to be a very interesting field. For fun, I run in cross country and track, and I play guitar with multiple bands. When I am not doing either of those things, I am often reading. I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy but I enjoy reading historical fiction books too. I also learn French on a language learning app, called Duolingo. On Duolingo, I have been learning the language for almost three years, and I have progressed very far into the curriculum. Along with my AP Biology and Band class, French is also one of my favorite subjects. I am proud that I got into AP Biology this year, since not many students get into the class in freshman year, and so far I have found the class very interesting. I have also gotten high honors with distinction in my school grades for four years in a row, showing my dedication to learning. Outside of school, I have made achievements through running a lot of personal records in my track meets, showing my over the seasons.</p>
	<p>I have many goals for the future, in addition to my achievements. I would like to improve my guitar skill, as well as increase my speed and endurance in running. I also am aiming to get  above a three on my AP Exam at the end of the school year; however, the goal I am working toward the most is deciding the area of study I would like to pursue when I graduate.</p>
