        <h1>Screenprinting Project</h1>
        <h2>By Sam Werlin</h2>

	<h3>Introduction and Requirements</h3>
	<p>In New Media and Tech class, we created custom screenprints. It started as learning about other screenprinting, and the famous posters from the past, and how they influenced history and trends seen today. Afterwards, we took the information we learned about how successful designs were created, and used them to come up with designs of our own. We asked ourselves questions such as “Who will see this?”, and “What purpose will this print serve?” to create an optimal design that would both reflect our likes and dislikes, and styles that we appreciated and wanted to show.</p>
        <p>The design had to include a picture of us, as well as some form of text included. Because playing electric guitar is one of my favorite hobbies, I chose to make my design revolve around that. I also decided to include the word “rhythm,” because that seemed to be what I played most in my band. I decided to keep the colors fairly blank, with a cool main color, and then an accent, like red. My final decision for my design was of my hands cupping a guitar, with the word underneath. The original concept picture can be seen below.</p>

	<h3>Building a Screenprint</h3>
	<p>To start our screenprints, we took pictures of ourselves for our design. We each got to take 3 pictures to choose from for our design. We also controlled the shot type, blur, shutter, depth and other elements to make sure that our picture was the best possible for our planned design. I used a close up shot on my hand with a 1/500 shutter and a F4.0 aperture. After I took the photo, I opened Adobe Photoshop. To start creating our design in photoshop, the first step was to separate every single excruciating detail into separate layers. I had several layers, between the specific parts for the photo that was taken of me (including the brighter and darker parts of my hand), the words present, and the guitar that would be shown. My filters were meant to separate everything into two distinct colors and make my hand look all one shade. After many layers and filters were used, I finally got something near to my planned design.</p>

	<p>The design was finished, so I separated the two colors into just two layers and opened them in adobe illustrator. Illustrator was necessary to find the sizes I needed the two print frames to be. It turned out I could make both prints the same sizes, so I measured out two frames to be 6.5 in long. I also needed to find out the right combinations of paint I needed to make the right color physically, so I added the CMYK combinations necessary for the right paint.</p>

	<p>I had finally finished all of the designing and planning necessary to make the screenprints. To start building the prints, we took long pieces of wood that would be used to build the print’s frame. I measured out four pieces of wood per frame with a 45 degree angle on each end. All of my wood pieces were the same size, so I cut out 8 equally sized pieces of wood for the two different print layers. To cut the pieces, I used a power saw to cut at 45 degree angles. Next, I glued my print frame pieces together. It was a two person job– I glued the wood together and held them in place while a partner stapled the pieces so they could sit and solidify. The next class, I stretched screens onto the frames and stapled those on very tightly. Now I had the main pieces of the screenprint ready. It was time to add the designs. I printed out vinyl stickers of our layers in a cutting tool and poked out the pieces that I wanted paint to go through. I then put the vinyl pieces onto the inside of our frames and ironed them into the screen, so that everything became connected. I also taped the sides and surroundings of the print so that the paint did not leak out outside where the stencil allowed it to. Finally, the screenprint was finished and I could begin printing my design. To print the design, we had to mix a paint color and put it on one end of the frame, press firmly onto the page, and then use a tool to press/slide the paint across the stencil. Then, all we could do was hope for the best result– our intended design.</p>

	<h3>Reflection and Results</h3>
	<p>I will be the first to admit that printing my design with the stencil did not go very smoothly. Part of the problem had to do with the fact that my design had to be printed in two parts, because I needed one day for each of my colors to dry on the print surface. Unfortunately, we only had two class periods to print, so I had to get it right the first try or I would be forced to work outside of class time (either after school or during lunch). That by itself was an unexpected development I had to prepare for. Then, it transpired that the small details in my design made it difficult to print the design, slowing down the process significantly. The final blow to the endgame of this project was that I turned out not to be that skilled at screenprinting. Together, these elements created the perfect recipe for disaster on the first day of printing. I mixed my paint shade at the beginning of class that day, and then proceeded to spend the rest of the period struggling to make one acceptable design, which I failed to do. I had not been able to make anything worth keeping during that day, and I was forced to spend the next lunch period making up work. On top of that, I ruined a pair of my pants by getting paint on them. But the next day, there was a ray of shining hope.</p>
	<p>Fortunately for me, screenprinting turns out to be a bit of a learning curve: After much work, I eventually managed to learn the skill of screenprinting. The next day, during my lunch period, I managed to print the first part of my design on a piece of paper, a piece of fabric, and a box. I had successfully begun my prints and learned a fun new skill, though still at the cost of my appetite. The last day also went relatively smoothly, but it was not without its own challenges. Another difficulty included with printing a design with two layers is that it is hard to line up the second part exactly with the first, and that was certainly the case with my design. But I persevered. Despite some mishaps with printing, I managed to get some layers that lined up pretty well, and I am certainly happy with how most of my prints turned out.</p>

	<p>Over the course of this project, I gained many new skills. My knowledge of photography and cameras grew, and then I learned how to use photoshop to bend my photographs into new ideas. After that, I learned to design and make a screenprint specifically based on my chosen photoshop design. I also discovered the influence of screenprinting throughout history, and the influential role they have played in the creation of political and wartime propaganda. For myself, the most exciting part of this project was done on the computer, in photoshop. I really enjoyed adjusting filters and adding layers to the design, and my end result in that area was really something I was truly proud of. The photoshop/computer design aspect of this project was definitely something I would love to continue expanding my knowledge of and learning about it will definitely help me grow as a person. Another part of the project that I really enjoyed was the teamwork necessary to make this project work. While making the frame for the screenprint, I was forced to work with a partner, and that was a good thing. I really appreciated being able to share the power and practice working with someone as opposed to just giving directions.</p>

	<h3>Our Shared Canvas: 21st Century Skills</h3>
	      <p>During this screenprinting project, I grew through increasing my understanding of one of the five 21st Century Competency skills necessary to graduate. That skill was Problem Solving and Critical Thinking, a skill that was easily reflected throughout this project, and one that was vital to the completion of a screenprint. This skill was learned through reasoning effectively, making insightful decisions, and problem solving. My effective reasoning was grown through using logic to create my screenprint design (it was based on my favorite hobbies, as well as who I wanted my print’s audience to be). My decisions were made more insightful by using feedback from friends and the fact that I could not make my screenprint three layers to make my design simpler and more fleshed out in photoshop. Finally, I became better at handling and solving problems by experiencing them while I printed the design on surfaces. This includes when I needed to make up work after failing to complete my first paint layer and I managed to start my design in thirty minutes and when I used light to find the right spot to print the second layer of the design.</p>
